# PortfolioProjects

<h3>A Data Analyst Project. </h3>

<b><h4> For Data Exploration </h4> </b> we used the covid-deaths dataset : https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths .

  This Dataset was then imported to oracle 11g database under two separate tables : Covid_Deaths & Covid_Vaccination.
  
  The code under the file "Update Portfolio Project SQL Script Part 1.sql" was used to create a public Tableau Dashboard : https://public.tableau.com/profile/ahmed.elloumi#!/?newProfile=&activeTab=0
